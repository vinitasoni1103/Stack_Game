# 🧱 Stack Game

> 🎮 A simple but addictive 3D stacking game .

## 📖 What is it?

This is a browser-based 3D **Stack Game** made using:
- **JavaScript**
- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **GSAP/TweenMax** for smooth animations

You just have to **click** (or press **spacebar**) at the right time to stack blocks on top of each other. As you go higher, the difficulty increases.

I originally built this to practice:
- DOM manipulation
- Working with 3D using `Three.js`
- Game loop logic
- JavaScript classes and objects
---

## 💡 How It Works

- Each block moves left and right.
- You press **space** or **click** to stop it.
- The more precise your placement, the higher your stack goes.
- If you miss too much, it's **Game Over**.
